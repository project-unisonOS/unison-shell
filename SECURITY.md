# Security

This Electron shell is intended for local developer mode and should be run on trusted machines against a local or controlled UnisonOS stack.

For overall security guidance, including wake-word and always-on behavior, see:

- https://project-unisonos.github.io/reference/security/

If you discover a security issue in the shell, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub rather than filing a public issue.
